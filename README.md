Welcome to Spare Engine; the 3D game engine I am developing in my spare time!

This project was created to refresh my understanding of C++ programming, as well as refresh my memory on programming concepts as a whole. It was also a great opportunity to gain an undertanding of the rendering pipeline in 3D graphics.

The engine is written in C++, and uses SDL2 for window management and OpenGL for 3D rendering.
Currently the engine has support for Shaders and can render 3D objects to the screen given a series of vertices.
3D transformations are also supported.

adding lighting and textures is next on the chopping block.
